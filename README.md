# FilmQueryProject


# Description
This is my film query app. At first the user gets prompted to 1.) look up a film by its ID, 2.) Look up a film by a search keyword, or 3.) which will quit out of the app. When the user selects to enter by film id, they will enter a whole number. If the number is not an id then they will get a prompt that says id could not be found and will be redirected to enter another id. If the number matched an ID then the films title, year, rating, description, language, and cast will be displayed. If the used choses to look up a film by a search keyword,  then the app will prompt  the user to enter a keyword. If the keyword does not match anything in the title or description of the film they will be told so and re directed to enter another keyword. If the user choses to quit they will get a message saying goodbye and the app will terminate.

# Lessons Learned
At first I was only getting one name over and over for my actor

I was getting a ID for language but could not tie it to its name

I was trying to put logic in the DBA class but then I switched it to the app and got things to work

SQL queries take me some time to write. I realized at firstI had done the pre work wrong but once I took the query step by step I started getting results I wanted for searching by a keyword

I felt pretty good overall about this homework assignment. I didn’t feel as lost as I have in the past (other than writing the queries) 

TAs helped me put together logic to get films to print out line by line and not all on one line by using a for each loop. Also they helped me tons with getting my toString correct and not to used my getters in my film class
 
Im not sure I have the DBA class correct but I tried copying the example that was provided in the labs on Friday, I felt like I barley changed anything and was successful from doing that. 
I selected a view in sublime to show SQL syntax and that helped me write and see my queries better. Also just being in mySQL and testing it on the database helped get the results I was looking for.

One thing I was not able to debug was when I would enter a comma into my search keyword I will get the prompt where it says there is no match but then I still get keyword results from title and description. Not sure why that is but I couldn’t fix it.
